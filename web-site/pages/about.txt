<strong>Next Generation Universal Collection Management System (UCM) for Museums, Galleries, Archives, Libraries, and Private Collections </strong>
<p>
<strong>Synopsis</strong>
The modern (need descriptor here?) Collection management software is designed to aid in the cataloging and managing of objects in a given collection. At present, there are several different collection management systems on the market, however almost none take advantage of modern social media platforms and XX technologies. Most of the current systems available do not incorporate collaboration, multimedia, and geotagging capabilities. These systems also lack the ability to build mobile tour apps based on user-defined collections. Such apps are in high demand today, helping our user provide better service to their visitors and separate them from the crowd.

The majority of the current collection management systems requires installation on ‘in house’ hardware, and thus creates significant upfront resource expenditures on identifying and purchasing hardware, software licensing, and hiring IT staff. These systems have complicated licensing schemes based on factors such as, number of collection objects, number of users, thus targeting large museums with significant in-house IT capabilities and budgets. Such solutions are prohibitively expensive and complicated for small to medium size organizations, such as non-profit museums, galleries, archives, libraries, and private collections.
